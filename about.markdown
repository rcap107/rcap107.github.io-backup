Hello, I am Riccardo Cappuzzo, a PhD student at [Eurecom](https://www.eurecom.fr), a leading institution in the field of telecommunication situated in Sophia Antipolis (France).

I am currently working on automated methods for performing data cleaning, with a specific interest in the application of word embeddings and transformer architectures to the problem. 

As I work mostly using Python and on Linux systems, the posts in this blog will revolve mainly around them.  

When I'm not asking myself why the heck my code doesn't run, I tend to play all sorts of videogames, or spend time reading up on history, engineering and other nerdy stuff.  

You can contact me via email (riccardo.cappuzzo AT eurecom.fr), or connect to me using [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riccardo-cappuzzo-33a364ab/). 

No Facebook or Twitter, sorry!

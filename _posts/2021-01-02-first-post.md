# What should you expect from this blog? 
I am planning to use this blog as a collection of articles that describe some of the problems I encounter while running my experiments, as well as the solutions I find for them. Since it appears that I have a knack for finding weird and hard to reproduce errors in the code I have to use (both mine and from other sources), you might find posts on a multitude of subjects:
* Complications encountered during the installation of a new repository. 
* Complications encountered while running a new repository. 
* Interesting experimental results.
* Summaries and demonstrations prepared using my code. 
* Updates on my publications.
* Miscellaneous nagging little issues (these might be collected in a single post to avoid clutter). 

# How often are updates going to be?
I have no idea at the moment. I will probably write up a few posts before advertising this post *anywhere*, so there should be at least some content to read by the time you might find this. Other than that, it'll depend on how often I'll find new and interesting problems that waste my time, and on me actually writing down the solution in a readable way. 

# Are you ever going to update your github profile? 
Hopefully this blog will be a compelling enough reason for me to get to do that in the future. No guarantees yet, though.
